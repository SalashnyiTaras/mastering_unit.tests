test_<filename> - it is a convention to name file with unit tests

be careful when naming tests - if a name of a test does not start with "test_",
a unit-test will be simply skipped

do not think that all tests being right in the order they were created: no, they do not

setUp() - creates an environment, to bu run right before each test
tearDown() - method used for cleaning the environment created in setUp(). Run right after completion of each test

If we want to run some code in the very beginning of the text and also after all tests will be run,
we can use:

    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls) -> None:
        print('text')

    @classmethod
    def tearDownClass(cls) -> None:
        print('text')


Case:
we have a function which goes to web-site and gets some data. If the website is down function will fail.
We do not want it because we want to test only errors in our code.
That is the best time for mocking to be used.

Best practices:
    - test should be independent and isolated
